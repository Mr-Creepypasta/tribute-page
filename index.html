  <h1>Black Holes</h1>
  <section class="first-section">
    <div class="left-side1">
<h2>What is a Black Hole?</h2>
<p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying. Since no light can escape a black hole, people can't see black holes. They're invisible to the naked eye so we have utilized space telescopes with special tools that can help us find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes act differently than other stars.</p>

<h2> How does a Black Hole form?</h2>
<p>Black holes are expected to form via 2 distinct channels. According to the first pathway, they are stellar corpses, so they form when massive stars die. Stars whose birth masses are above roughly 8 to 10 times the mass of our sun, when they exhaust all their fuel, their hydrogen, they explode and die leaving behind a very compact dense object, a black hole. The resulting black hole that is left behind is referred to as a stellar mass black hole and its mass is of the order of a few times the mass of the sun. Not all stars leave behind black holes, stars with lower birth masses leave behind a neutron star or a white dwarf. Another way that black holes form is from the direct collapse of gas, a process that is expected to result in more massive black holes with a mass ranging from 1000 times the mass of the sun up to even 100,000 times the mass of the sun. This channel circumvents the formation of the traditional star, and is believed to operate in the early universe and produce more massive black hole seeds.</p>

<h2>The Sound of a Black Hole.</h2>
<p>A new sonification turns X-ray data of “light echoes” captured by NASA's Chandra and Swift X-ray observatories into sound. One of the surprising features of black holes is that although light (such as radio, visible, and X-rays) cannot escape from them, surrounding material can produce intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation. As they travel outward, these blasts of light can bounce off clouds of gas and dust in space, similar to how light beams from a car's headlight will scatter off fog. A new sonification turns these “light echoes” from the black hole called V404 Cygni into sound. Located about 7,800 light-years from Earth, V404 Cygni is a system that contains a black hole, with a mass between five and 10 times the Sun's, that is pulling material from a companion star in orbit around it. The material is funneled into a disk that encircles the stellar-mass black hole. This material periodically generates bursts of radiation, including X-rays. As the X-rays travel outward they encounter clouds of gas and dust in between V404 Cygni and Earth and are scattered at various angles. NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory have imaged the X-ray light echoes around V404 Cygni. Because astronomers know exactly how fast light travels and have determined an accurate distance to this system, they can calculate when these eruptions occurred. This data, plus other information, helps astronomers learn more about the dust clouds, including their composition and distances.</p>

<h2>Does a Black Hole die?</h2>
<p>Black holes do not die per say, but they are theoretically predicted to eventually slowly evaporate over extremely long time scales. Black holes grow by the accretion of matter nearby that is pulled in by their immense gravity. Hawking predicted that black holes could also radiate away energy and shrink very slowly. Quantum theory suggests that there exist virtual particles popping in and out of existence all the time. When this happens, a particle and its companion anti-particle appear. However, they can also recombine and disappear again. When this process occurs near the event horizon of a black hole, strange things can happen. Instead of the particle antiparticle pair existing for a moment and then annihilating each other, one of them can get by gravity and fall into the black hole, while the other particle can fly off into space. Over very long timescales, we are speaking about timescales that are much much longer than the age of our universe, the theory states that this trickle of escaping particles will cause the black hole to slowly evaporate.</p>

<h2>The Different Types of Black Holes.</h2>
<p>So far, astronomers have identified three types of black holes: stellar black holes, supermassive black holes and intermediate black holes.</p>
<div class="types">
<div class="stellar">
<h3>Stellar Black Holes</h3>
<p>When a star burns through the last of its fuel, the object may collapse, or fall into itself. For smaller stars (those up to about three times the sun's mass), the new core will become a neutron star or a white dwarf. But when a larger star collapses, it continues to compress and creates a stellar black hole. Black holes formed by the collapse of individual stars are relatively small but incredibly dense. One of these objects packs more than three times the mass of the sun into the diameter of a city. This leads to a crazy amount of gravitational force pulling on objects around the object. Stellar black holes then consume the dust and gas from their surrounding galaxies, which keeps them growing in size.</p>

</div>
<div class="supermassive">
<h3>Supermassive Black Holes</h3>
<p>Small black holes populate the universe, but their cousins, supermassive black holes, dominate. These enormous black holes are millions or even billions of times as massive as the sun but are about the same size in diameter. Such black holes are thought to lie at the center of pretty much every galaxy, including the Milky Way. Scientists aren't certain how such large black holes spawn. Once these giants have formed, they gather mass from the dust and gas around them, material that is plentiful in the center of galaxies, allowing them to grow to even more enormous sizes. Supermassive black holes may be the result of hundreds or thousands of tiny black holes that merge. Large gas clouds could also be responsible, collapsing together and rapidly accreting mass. A third option is the collapse of a stellar cluster, a group of stars all falling together. Fourth, supermassive black holes could arise from large clusters of dark matter. This is a substance that we can observe through its gravitational effect on other objects; however, we don't know what dark matter is composed of because it does not emit light and cannot be directly observed.</p>

</div>
<div class="intermediate">
<h3>Intermediate Black Holes</h3>
<p>Scientists once thought that black holes came in only small and large sizes, but research has revealed the possibility that midsize, or intermediate, black holes could exist. Such bodies could form when stars in a cluster collide in a chain reaction. Several of these black holes could be forming in the same region could then eventually fall together in the center of a galaxy and create a supermassive black hole. In 2014, astronomers found what appeared to be an intermediate-mass black hole in the arm of a spiral galaxy. And in 2021 astronomers took advantage of an ancient gamma-ray burst to detect one. "Astronomers have been looking very hard for these medium-sized black holes," study co-author Tim Roberts, of the University of Durham in the United Kingdom, said in a statement. "There have been hints that they exist, but they have been acting like a long-lost relative that isn't interested in being found." Research, from 2018, suggested that these black holes may exist in the heart of dwarf galaxies (or very small galaxies). Observations of 10 such galaxies (five of which were previously unknown to science before this latest survey) revealed X-ray activity, common in black holes, suggesting the presence of black holes of from 36,000 to 316,000 solar masses. The information came from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which examines about 1 million galaxies and can detect the kind of light often observed coming from black holes that are picking up nearby debris.</p>

<h2>What would happen if you fell inside of a Black Hole?</h2>
<p>So, the big question, what would happen if you fell into a black hole?  Well, the prognosis isn't great, to be truthful, whichever sort of black hole you picked. If you leapt heroically into a stellar-mass black hole, your body would be subjected to a process called 'spaghettification' (no, really, it is).  The black hole's gravity force would compress you from top to toe, while stretching you at the same time…thus, spaghetti. A supermassive black hole has a slightly less horrendous effect, so let's imagine then that you opt for one of these to make your giant leap for mankind and scientific research. Sagittarius A* (pronounced “Sagittarius A-star”, and abbreviated as Sgr A*) is a supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way, believed to be around 44 million km across and containing approximately 4.31 million solar masses. It was discovered in 1974 by two astronomers, Bruce Balick and Robert L Brown, but remained unnamed until 1982. Your journey into Sagittarius A* itself would begin after you slip over the event horizon, the point of no return.  You would be able to see out from inside, but no-one would be able to see you because any light would fall back on you.  The good news is that although the gravitational pull is much stronger than smaller black holes, the stretching tidal force is less, meaning you won't be turned into spaghetti. But the bad news is you wouldn't be able to get out or could you? Well, your hope lies in the theory of “white holes”. Put simply, if a black hole sucks things in, then a white hole spits them out again, wherever that may be, and the two are connected via an inter-dimensional tunnel, known as a wormhole. Or, it's also hypothesized, if you wait long enough, the black hole will turn into a white one, anyway. This process is thought to take billions of years, but there's no reason to be disheartened. Why? Well, due to the intense gravitational forces within, time would be speeded up for you so it would be over in a matter of milliseconds. Of course, at present, this is only a theory. If you want more proof of the inadvisability of swan-diving into a black hole, consider the 'tidal disruption' picked up by three NASA telescopes in 2014.  It was caused by a star that had come too close to a black hole at the center of a galaxy, about 290 million light years away. It was distorted, stretched, and shredded as it was sucked into the singularity, while the residue of the destroyed star was flung out in a 'cosmic belch'.</p>
